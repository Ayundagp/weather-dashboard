# Weather Dashboard

## Project Overview
The Weather Dashboard is a web application designed to provide real-time weather updates. Using a clean and modern interface developed with Tailwind CSS, the application allows users to view current weather conditions, wind details, and precipitation information. The data is fetched through a mock API, which simulates responses you would expect from a live weather data service.

## Installation

To get started with the Weather Dashboard, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-dashboard.git
   cd weather-dashboard
   ```

2. **Run the Server**
   You can run the server using Python3. Ensure that you have Python installed on your machine.

   ```bash
   python3 server.py
   ```

   This will start the server on `http://localhost:8000`.

3. **Open the Application**
   Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8000` to view the Weather Dashboard.

## Usage

Once the server is running, navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your favorite web browser. The dashboard will load and display the real-time weather updates. You can refresh the data by clicking the "Refresh" button.

## Features

- **Real-Time Weather Updates**: Get immediate access to current weather data.
- **Wind and Precipitation Details**: View detailed information about wind speeds and precipitation.
- **Responsive Design**: Intuitive interface that works seamlessly across devices.
- **Dynamic Content**: Weather data is fetched dynamically to ensure up-to-date information.
  
## Dependencies

While the project does not use a package.json file explicitly, the following libraries are included in the `index.html` for styling and icons:

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A utility-first CSS framework for modern web designs.
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - A toolkit for icons and social logos.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

```
weather-dashboard/
│
├── index.html        # The main HTML file of the Weather Dashboard
├── proxy.py          # A mock proxy server to simulate API behavior
├── server.py         # An alternative server implementation for handling weather data
└── css/
    └── styles.css    # Custom styles (if any are created)
```

- **index.html**: The entry point of the application containing the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **proxy.py** and **server.py**: Both are implementations of a basic HTTP server that generates mock weather data as a JSON response for demonstration purposes.
